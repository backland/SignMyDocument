# SignMyDocument
The drive for this application is to avoid the need to print and then scan a signed document such as a informed financial consent.  The application will present the document for the person to read and then capture a persons signature using a HTML5 Canvas element. It will then upload the signature image, merge it with the document and store the document in the document repository.  This will initially be developed to work with the CSC webPAS Patient Administration Solution but maybe forked and extended to work with other CSC Applications.
